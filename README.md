# RhinoBot: The music bot for Discord.

MusicBot is a Discord music bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage"). It plays requested songs and if the queue becomes empty it will play through a list of existing songs.


Please note that this is a fork of https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot/ combining alot of forks to just one fork. The code is one big mess sorry :(
